	<h2>Career Plans</h2>
	<p>I plan on getting an internship or job in IT, System Administration, or Software Development, and also plan to go to a technical school to study cybersecurity. </p>

	<h2>Why Computers?</h2>
	<p>Technnology has already become ubiquitous in contemporary society, and technology's influence will only grow. (Assuming an apocalypse does not occur) 
		I love working with computers because of the challenging logical problems presented by them and their failures. I think very literally, much like computers do. 
		If a computer makes a mistake, it is because a person (AI overlords of the future are people too!) made a mistake somewhere, the computer does exactly as it is told.</p>
